                    There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for
                    business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has
                    a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your
                    visibility.

                    As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business,
                    you rely on blogging to help you get to these consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging,
                    your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.

                    So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost
                    your traffic and send quality leads to your website.

                    The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get
                    discovered and visited by your target audience. Which means, a blog is an effective lead generation
                    tool. Add a great call to action (CTA), and it will convert your website traffic into high-quality
                    leads. But a blog also allows you to showcase your authority and build a brand.

                    When you use your niche knowledge for creating informative and engaging posts, it builds trust with
                    your audience. Great blogging makes your business looks more credible, which is especially important
                    if your brand is still young and fairly unknown. It ensures presence and authority at the same time.
